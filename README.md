A variety of algorithms to solve mazes from an input image

# About
These are the python files associated with the computerphile video on maze solving. Feel free to use, alter, redistribute the code as you see fit.
The Maze Project was part of course, using javaFX and java.
it was build in 3 parts:
1. Algorithmes to generate the mazeand solve it.
2. Threads and Streams - client servers side.
3. Desktop application using MVVM and GUI.
